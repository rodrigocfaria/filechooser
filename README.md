# filechooser
A very basic and simple filechooser for Windows written in Python and Kivy, that I created for another project, Pasu-chan.

## External dependencies
This software needs the following external Python modules:
* Kivy

## How to use
When you click the OK button on its screen, a file called `filechooser_result` will be written in the folder which filechooser is running. Just read it.

## What is a "pasu file"?
I wrote this program because I needed for another program. Modify the code to fit your needs.
